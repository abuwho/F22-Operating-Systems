In the program, for each fork() call, a new Child Process will be created. 


* For the first run, n = 3. Therefore, 3 Child Processes are created. 
   1
 1 2 1
1 3 3 1
Number of processes = 2^3 = 8


* For the second run, n = 5. Therefore, 5 Child processes are created.

Number of processes = 2^5 = 32

The hierarchy of the pstree will have the form of a binomial tree.
